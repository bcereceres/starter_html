            <p>Pappy is a 7 year old morkie. Most days he prefers to spend it laying around the house in his various favorite spots. Most of the time you can find him lying in his bed. He loves going with walks, but still hasn’t figured out how to approach other dogs without scaring them off. He loves his family and loves to keep intruders away even for his size.</p>
            <p>He also enjoys playing with his favorite basketball. He loves pushing it around, scratching it, or even talking with it. He also loves his little stuffed animal too. Pappy also loves to be scratched and will ask you to keep scratching until he is happy.</p>

            <img src = "images/molly_on_cabinet.JPG" width = 400 alt = "Calico cat with orange, white, and black coloring sitting on cabinet">
            <p>Molly is an 18 year old calico cat. She prefers spending her days lounging on the couch or curled up sleeping over a vent (or anything warm). Occasionally, she’ll go outside and attempt to hunt birds or rats (sometimes successful which is terrifying).</p>
            <p> Molly’s favorite habit is to brush against people’s legs, especially during dinner when everyone is seated around a table. She’s an attention seeker, always meowing to get as many pets and head rubs as she possibly can.</p>

            <img src="images/Jingle.jpg" width="400" alt="Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His paws are white and they look like mittens">
            <p>Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out.</p>
            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>

            <img src="images/daisy_defeats_snake.jpg" width="400" alt="Daisy is an 8 year old black and white Morkie (Maltese-Yorkie)">
            <p>When Daisy isn’t busy slaying all of the evil snakes trying to attack us (Pictured Above), you can usually find her annoying her older sister Marina, getting super hyper at completely random times, or relaxing in our backyard making sure she keeps out all of the intruders (squirrels)</p>
            <p>One of Daisy’s favorite things to do is beg to go on a walk, and then once we’re about half way done with the walk she likes to lay down and refuse to keep going. She then loves being carried all the way back from said walk, and the process will repeat again later in the day.</p>
